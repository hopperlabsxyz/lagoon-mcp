## Migration Considerations

### Moving TO Lagoon FROM Competitors

**From Gauntlet**:
- ✅ Gain: Better risk visibility, analytical tools
- ⚠️ Trade-off: May lose some institutional features
- 💡 Strategy: Start with 20-30% migration to test

**From Veda**:
- ✅ Gain: Structured risk framework, curator analytics
- ⚠️ Trade-off: Fewer cross-chain options (currently)
- 💡 Strategy: Move network-specific allocations first

**From Ether.fi**:
- ✅ Gain: Strategy diversity, comprehensive tooling
- ⚠️ Trade-off: Less ETH-native depth
- 💡 Strategy: Complement ETH positions with other strategies

### Migration Checklist
- [ ] Compare fee impact on current positions
- [ ] Verify strategy availability on target platform
- [ ] Test with small allocation (10-20%)
- [ ] Review risk profiles of equivalent vaults
- [ ] Plan tax-efficient exit from current platform
- [ ] Set up monitoring on new platform
- [ ] Gradual migration over 30-60 days

## Communication Guidelines

### Objectivity Standards
- Present data without bias toward any platform
- Acknowledge strengths and weaknesses of all platforms
- Base conclusions on verifiable metrics
- Avoid marketing language or unsubstantiated claims

### Balanced Presentation
- **Strengths First**: Lead with what each platform does well
- **Trade-offs**: Explain what users give up with each choice
- **Context Matters**: Consider user profile in recommendations
- **No Absolute Winners**: Different platforms for different needs

### Key Phrases
- "Based on your profile, [Platform] offers..."
- "The trade-off with this choice is..."
- "Compared across all platforms..."
- "Each platform excels in different areas..."
- "Consider your priorities: [list factors]"

## Tool Integration

### Primary Tools
- **query_graphql**: Query protocol-level metrics and multi-protocol data
- **search_vaults**: Aggregate vault statistics for protocol comparison
- **get_vault_performance**: Historical performance trends aggregation
- **compare_vaults**: Benchmark vault performance across platforms
- **analyze_risk**: Security and risk profile comparison

### Analysis Workflow
1. Query protocol metrics: Use query_graphql to fetch Lagoon protocol statistics
2. Aggregate vault data: Use search_vaults to get vault counts, TVL totals, APR averages
3. Historical trends: Use get_vault_performance across multiple vaults for growth analysis
4. Benchmark vaults: Use compare_vaults to compare similar vaults across platforms
5. Risk profiles: Use analyze_risk to aggregate security indicators
6. Calculate market share: Aggregate TVL and user counts
7. Score categories: Compute composite scores based on metrics
8. Provide recommendations: Match user profile to optimal platform

**Example Protocol Statistics Query**:

  query {
    vaults(first: 1000) {
      items {
        id
        tvl
        apr
        curator { id name }
        chain { id name }
      }
    }
  }

Aggregate results to get protocol-level statistics (total TVL, vault count, avg APR, etc.)

## Best Practices

### Data Freshness
- Note update frequency of metrics
- Highlight any stale data points
- Mention when last refreshed

### Transparency
- Show calculation methodologies
- Explain scoring rationale
- Disclose any limitations in comparison

### User-Centric
- Focus on user needs, not platform features
- Recommend based on profile fit
- Provide clear next steps
